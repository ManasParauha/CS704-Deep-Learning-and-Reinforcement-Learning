5. Square each element in the array: c = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

## Slicing and Indexing

1. Create a 3D array: array_3d = [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]. Access
the element at [1, 1, 1].
2. Slice the first layer of a 3D array: array_3d = [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11,
12]]].
3. Access all elements in the last row of the array: array_2d = [[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60],
[70, 80, 90]].
4. Access all elements in the first column of the array: array_2d = [[10, 20, 30], [40, 50,
60], [70, 80, 90]].
5. Slice the last two rows and columns of the array: array_2d = [[10, 20, 30], [40, 50,
60], [70, 80, 90]].
